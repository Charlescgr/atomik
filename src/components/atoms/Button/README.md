Buttons express what action will occur when the user clicks or touches it. Buttons are used to initialize an action, either in the background or foreground of an experience.

Buttons are used primarily on action items. Some examples include Add, Save, Delete, and Sign up. Each page can have one or two primary buttons. Any remaining calls-to-action should be represented as secondary buttons.

Do not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use links when the desired action is to take the user to a new page.
